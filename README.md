# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-Chatbot
Built a semantic search system for querying documents, using LangChain for orchestration and Pinecone as vector DB. Ingested PDFs, applied embeddings for retrieval, and integrated OpenAI LLM for generating context-aware responses. Optimized chunking for low-latency queries, achieving high recall in multi-turn conversations.
